Take the default `dotnet new` templates and apply the steps described on this site, and you get [tailblazor-templates](https://github.com/McNerdius/TailBlazor-Templates){target="_blank"}.  The `tailblazor-wasm` template is hosted at [templates.tailblazor.dev](https://templates.tailblazor.dev){target="_blank"}.

::: info

With MAUI/Blazor Hybrid not being what i'd hoped, a `tailblazor-maui` template won't be happening anytime soon, if ever.  (The setup process is much like that of a WASM project.)  This voids one of the `tailblazor-templates` goals: to be a complete Blazor + Tailwind template package.

<h2>NuGet tools / MSBuild Inline Tasks in place of <code>node.js</code> boilerplate. {#nuget}</h2>
<p>There are tools/libraries/tutorials that abstract either the standalone executable or node.js version of <code>tailwindcss</code>, none without compromise.  That's specifically why this site exists: To show how it can be done with minimal compromise.  Removing that abstraction, we are left with three boilerplate files for node.js functionality, and an MSBuild &quot;Targets&quot; file to tie it all together.  These files are straightforward - specifying dependencies and pointing to files on disk.  We are learning and using <code>tailwindcss</code> itself, no JS build tools are involved.  The deepest we get into the JS ecosystem is through plugins, each involving an <code>npm install -D</code> and adding a &quot;hey use this&quot; line to the appropriate config file.  This is no more complex than using a dotnet abstraction and eliminates compromises.</p>

<p>A different approach to integrating Scoped CSS: Overwriting scoped styles with a Tailwind-processed version of itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is basically a for-each loop over all the generated scoped CSS files that call the Tailwind CLI for each one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Must bypass JIT to do this. Hot Reload + Incremental builds could result in an infinite CSS-rewriting loop (?)</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To understand what's going on during a build, you can use a verbose output of dotnet build and see all the involved msbuild magic - to find a suitable target you can use to plug in your custom CSS preprocessing logic. I've already done that and identified a target named <code>_GenerateScopedCssFiles</code></p>

# TailBlazor Goals:

- [x] 1. Take advantage of Tailwind's [JIT mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode), which watches your `razor`/`css`/`html`/`cshtml` for fast intermediate builds, emitting only new classes as needed.
- [x] 2. Use Tailwind's [`@apply` composition feature](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) together with Blazor's [CSS Isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation).
- [x] 3. Minimal complexity.
- [ ] 4. Optimal run/debug setups, given the above goals.
- [ ] 5. A set of [Runnable Templates]. Templates are awesome, but so is being able to see what's going on by just browsing the code / cloning the repo.

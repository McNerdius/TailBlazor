# Options for tidy CSS files
## Scoped CSS, `@apply`, and nesting

Idiomatic usage of Tailwind puts the bulk of CSS styling directly in your component's HTML, but you'll probably end up having some CSS files around.  Let's look at some Blazor and Tailwind CSS features that can help us out, and how to set things up so they can work together.

---

## Blazor's CSS Isolation

Using [CSS Isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-6.0){target="_blank"} does a couple things for us.  First, it is a bit like a C# `namespace` for our Components' CSS.  For a component `Foo.razor`, any CSS file named  using the convention `Foo.razor.css` will be a "Scoped CSS" file.  CSS in this file will be preprocessed so as to only apply to `Foo.razor`.  From the docs:

> For each styled component, an HTML attribute is appended with the format b-{STRING}, where the {STRING} placeholder is a ten-character string generated by the framework. The identifier is unique for each app. In the rendered Counter component, Blazor appends a scope identifier to the h1 element: `<h1 b-3xxtam6d07>`

  Second, it bundles the preprocessed Scoped CSS files into a bundle, `Site.styles.css` for a project `Site.csproj`.  If you're OK with using vanilla CSS in your scoped CSS files, toss in `<link href="Site.styles.css" rel="stylesheet">` as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-6.0#css-isolation-bundling){target="_blank"} and you're done.

The bundling is handy even if the Scoping/Isolation doesn't add much value for a particular project.

## Tailwind's `@apply` directive

A tiny rant about tidy HTML then i'll get back to the tidy CSS bits.  A relevant snippet from [the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply){target="_blank"}:

> Whatever you do, don’t use @apply just to make things look “cleaner”. Yes, HTML templates littered with Tailwind classes are kind of ugly. Making changes in a project that has tons of custom CSS is worse.

A common, valid criticism of the utility-class approach is that long strings of class names gets hard to read, requiring "horizontal panning" of the eyes.  What i don't understand is - why in all of the Tailwind CSS samples i see are all of the class strings on one line ?  In C# (and other languages of course), if a method has more than a few parameters, we format & indent them to look pretty.  This is an option in HTML class strings as well.  If my HTML is getting messy, i group my classes over multiple lines, grouping classes semantically.  Maybe i put font size/color classes on one line, padding/margins on the next, dark mode on another, give each responsive breakpoint a line of their own, and so on.  A line becomes a rectangle.  

OK with that out of my system, back to `@apply`, which lets us cut long class strings out of our HTML and paste them into a `css` file and go on our way.  Let's look at this site's [IconLink](https://github.com/McNerdius/TailBlazor/tree/main/Source/Components/IconLink){target="_blank"} Component as an example.  Without using `@apply` it would look something like this:

```html:IconLink.razor
<div class="font-semibold text-base 
            leading-none 
            rounded-[4px]
            transition[font-size,width]
            stroke-black dark:stroke-white 
            hover:no-underline 
            hover:bg-neutral-200/80
            hover:dark:bg-neutral-700/70">
    ...
</div>
```

I had to create a `.css` file for this component to style Blazor's `NavLink`, so i figured i'd pull this out while i was at it:

```html:IconLink.razor
<div class="link-container">
    ...
</div>
```

```css:IconLink.razor.css
.link-container {
  @apply font-semibold text-base 
         leading-none 
         rounded-[4px] 
         transition-[font-size,width]
         stroke-black dark:stroke-white
         hover:no-underline 
         hover:bg-neutral-200/80
         hover:dark:bg-neutral-700/70;
}
```

A simple cut-paste is all it takes.  Without using `@apply` that'd translate to something like:

```css:IconLink.razor.css
.link-container {
  border-radius: 4px;
  stroke: #000;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  line-height: 1;
  transition-property: font-size,width;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  transition-duration: 150ms
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .link-container {
    stroke: #fff
  }
}
.link-container:hover {
  background-color: rgb(229 229 229 / 0.8);
  -webkit-text-decoration-line: none;
          text-decoration-line: none
}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .link-container:hover {
    background-color: rgb(64 64 64 / 0.7)
  }
}
```

Note i've put this in a `*.razor.css` file.  **You could also just drop the `razor.` and `@import` the file directly in `site.css` and skip the Blazor integration steps that follow.**  But it only takes a couple edits to take advantage of CSS Isolation and only have to `@import` the Blazor-generated `site.styles.css` bundle.

### Enter `postcss-import`

Rewind back to the initial `npm install`, i advised including `postcss-import`.  Here's why.  

Without `postcss-import`:

[![without-postcss-import](/images/without_postcss_import.png)](./images/without_postcss_import.png){target="_blank"}

The output is valid, vanilla CSS, but it's not what we're after.  `test.css` hasn't been processed by `tailwindcss`.

With `postcss-import`:

[![with-postcss-import](/images/with_postcss_import.png)](./images/with_postcss_import.png){target="_blank"}

That `test.css` is using `@apply` is actually irrelevant: without using `postcss-import`, any `@import` other than an `@import "tailwindcss/{layer}";` goes unprocessed by the `tailwindcss` CLI.  It's not included in the `site.min.css` bundle.  So even if you're only ever going to `@import` vanilla CSS, if you want `tailwindcss` to it run through `autoprefixer` & `cssnano` then bundle it into `site.min.css`, you'll be using `postcss-import`.  The likelihood that you'll import more than zero CSS files at some point is good enough that i advise including it from the start.  It's 40kb on disk and costs nothing more if you don't end up taking advantage of it.

[todo: better example/added clarity]

::: info
Here comes the necessary tweaks:  When we use `@apply` in a Scoped CSS file, the Blazor-generated `Site.styles.css` is no longer Vanilla CSS, and can't be linked directly in your HTML as shown [in the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-6.0#css-isolation-bundling){target="_blank"}.
:::

By default, for a project `Site.csproj`, the CSS Isolation will be output to `obj/{CONFIGURATION}/{TARGET FRAMEWORK}/scopedcss/bundle/Site.styles.css` and copied to `wwwroot` when the project is published - `{Configuration}` typically being `Debug` or `Release`.  Let's tweak `Site.csproj` so the filename is constant:

```xml:Site.csproj
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    ...
+    <IntermediateOutputPath>obj</IntermediateOutputPath>
    ...
</PropertyGroup>
```

The bundle will now be output to `/obj/net6.0/scopedcss/bundle` for both `build` and `publish`.  Add this file to the root CSS created earler, `site.css`:


```css:site.css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
+@import "./obj/net6.0/scopedcss/bundle/site.styles.css";
```

::: info
If you don't actually use Scoped CSS (`*.razor.css`), a `*.styles.css` bundle will not be created on disk and the build will fail !
:::

::: info
If you run `npm run build` before `dotnet build`, `site.styles.css` will not exist on disk and it will fail !
:::

If you're using a `watch` script, it's a good idea to wait on `site.styles.css` to be created:

```powershell:watch.ps1
dotnet build -p:TailwindBuild=false
start "dotnet" -ArgumentList "watch" 
+while (!(Test-Path "./obj/net6.0/scopedcss/bundle/site.styles.css")) { sleep -ms 100 } 
while (!(Test-Path "./node_modules/.install-stamp")) { sleep -ms 100 } 
npm run watch
```

Both files need to be on disk or `npm run watch` will fail.

## Nesting - there if you want it

Sass-like [nesting is included](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting){target="_blank"} with `tailwindcss` and enabled by adding a line to your `postcss.config.js`:

```javascript:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        'postcss-import': {},
+        'tailwindcss/nesting': {},
        tailwindcss: {},
    },
}
```

*(You'll have to have modified your `site.csproj` and `site.css` as mentioned above as well.)*

A couple scenarios where i use nesting:

* Where i can't use CSS Isolation.  This site's content is embedded and rendered using [MarkupString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.components.markupstring?view=aspnetcore-6.0){target="_blank"}.  Because the embedded HTML is not part of the component being used to render it, the necessary `b-string`s are absent, and styles would not be applied.  Instead i wrap the `MarkupString` in a `<div class="markdown">` and [nest away](https://github.com/McNerdius/TailBlazor/blob/main/Source/Pages/Markdown.nested.css){target="_blank"}.  

* To un-stack [some stackables](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states){target="_blank"}.  Being able to "stack" variants is handy: `class="dark:hover:bg-foo"` but can get repetetive.  If i've already moved the classes out of my HTML into a CSS file, i may end up un-stacking some things.  Revisiting the `IconLink` CSS above:

```css:IconLink.razor.css
.link-container {
  @apply font-semibold text-base 
         leading-none 
         rounded-[4px] 
         transition-[font-size,width]
         stroke-black dark:stroke-white
         hover:no-underline 
         hover:bg-neutral-200/80
         hover:dark:bg-neutral-700/70;
}
```

What you'll find i'm actually using is:

```css:IconLink.razor.css
.link-container {
  @apply font-semibold text-base 
         leading-none 
         rounded-[4px] 
         transition-[font-size,width]
         stroke-black dark:stroke-white;
  &:hover {
    @apply no-underline bg-neutral-200/80 dark:bg-neutral-700/70;
  }
}
```

Because why not ?
